			<li>What is this?</li>
			<p>We believe that this is the one and only Movie/Serie database you will ever need in your life.</p>
			<br>
			<li>Why this? We already have IMDB and similar well established movie database sites.</li>
			<p>This is true, but we believe that our competitors can not provide anything near as good as Movie/Serie database. We challenge you to try it out and prove us wrong!</p>
			<br>
			<li>Sounds tempting, so how do I use it?</li>
			<p>We have tried to simplify the user experience without compromising the beautiful site design. Our site is light to use and scales beautifully on any device.
			The best way to learn how to use it, is by trying all the functionalities out yourself, within the limits of our terms and conditions, naturally.</p>
			<br>
			<li>But I never accepted any terms or conditions...</li>
			<p>By entering and remaining in our site, you have approved all our terms and conditions, as stated in our 
			<a href="terms.html" class="load-content">terms and conditions</a>.</p>
			<br>
			<li>I am impressed and full of ideas, how can I contribute in developement process?</li>
			<p>We are happy to receive any feedback and ideas by email, which you can find from 
			<a href="contact.html" class="load-content">Contact Us</a> section. 
			We as well hope you will keep on reviewing movies/series, both good and bad experiences and thus grow our content!</p><br><br>
